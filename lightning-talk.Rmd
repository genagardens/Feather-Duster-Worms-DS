## Total growth

### Check for normality
```{r}
growth_total_ds <- tube_growth %>%
  select(total_growth_DS)

shapiro.test(total_growth_DS)
```

### histogram and qqplot
```{r}

qqnorm(growth_total)
qqline(growth_total)
```

### Finding distribution of data
```{r}
descdist(tube_growth$total_growth)
```



### Anova
```{r}
aov_total_growth <- aov(total_growth ~ treatment + (1|worm_id)+ (1|amt_cut_mm), data = tube-growth)
```


## Timestep growth

#### check for normality

shapiro.test(growth_ts_1)

# second timestep
growth_ts_2 <- tube-growth %>%
  select(growth_2)

# trying to gaussianize the growth_2 distribution to make it normal (also tried with defalt type for gaussianize function)

transform_2 <- Gaussianize(tube_growth$growth_2, type = "hh") 

hist(transform_2)

shapiro.test(transform_2)

shapiro.test(growth_ts_2)

# third timestep

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
